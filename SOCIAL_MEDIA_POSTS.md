Thrilled to share that my open-source package, React Native Files Picker, is now featured on the React Native Directory!

This zero-permission file picker solves a real problem for mobile developers who care about user privacy. Instead of requesting invasive storage permissions, it uses modern platform APIs like Android Photo Picker (API 33+) and iOS PHPicker that provide scoped access to only user-selected files.

Key benefits:
✅ Zero permissions required
✅ Better app store ratings
✅ Privacy-first approach
✅ Simple, clean API
✅ Production-ready with TypeScript support
