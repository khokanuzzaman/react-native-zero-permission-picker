Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share React Native Files Picker - a zero-permission file picker for React Native apps.

🔑 The Problem:
Most file picker libraries require storage permissions, which creates privacy concerns and can hurt app store ratings. Users are becoming increasingly privacy-conscious.

✨ The Solution:
React Native Files Picker uses modern platform APIs (Android Photo Picker & iOS PHPicker) that don't require any permissions. Your app only gets access to files the user explicitly selects.

🎯 Key Features:
• 🚫 Zero permissions required
• 📱 Modern APIs (Android 13+ Photo Picker, iOS PHPicker)
• 🔄 Backward compatible (SAF fallback for older Android)
• 🎯 Simple API - just 2 functions
• ⚡ Production ready with TypeScript support
• 📊 Rich metadata (file size, dimensions, duration)

💻 Quick Start:
```typescript
import { pickMedia } from 'react-native-files-picker';

const images = await pickMedia('image', { multiple: true });
```

That's it! No permissions, no configuration - just works.

🚀 Built for React Native developers who want:
- Privacy-first file selection
- Better app store ratings
- Modern platform APIs
- Simple, clean API

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! What would make this even better for your use case?
